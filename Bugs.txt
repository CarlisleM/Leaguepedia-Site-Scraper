Bugs/To Do List

First Tower better

If inhibitor or objectives taken at the same time they stack and cant be detected	

Date format sometimes swaps if switching between euw.matchhistory and na.matchhistory

Adjust sleep timer, try and make it lower but wait for data if data is missing (sometimes does not load in time) - Maybe wait for a particular element I know loads last to be loaded

Dont collect already collected data - cross reference with data base so running the scraper only gives new data and saves time

Check if certain elements aexist before beginning as some do not have history (rare), maybe wait for all elements to load but if they dont after x (10?) seconds proceed to the next match
